To aid in my studying, I needed a practice environment. This environment needed the ability to be easily destroyed and recreated. Configuring a proper lab environment by hand was eating up too much of my valuable study time. This project will create an environment that is suitable for certification practice. This project provides environments for each of the following certifications: RHCSA LFCS (WIP) RHCE (WIP) Each environment works on Windows 10 and macOS. VirtualBox is the only supported hypervisor. Project Mission \u00b6 Provide an easy-to-use, cross-platform lab environment for Linux training. Project Goals \u00b6 Automate base boxes creation with packer and Ansible Host boxes on the Vagrant Cloud Automate the management of the lab environment Project Requirements \u00b6 Vagrant - A tool for building and managing virtual machine environments VirtualBox - Cross-platform hypervisor Cygwin - A large collection of GNU and Open Source tools for Windows Base Boxes \u00b6 Two main boxes are used throughout the environments, IPA server and lab server. Both boxes are installed with CentOS 7.0. IPA Server \u00b6 Services running on this server are LDAP, DNS, and NFS. This server hosts a YUM repository from the contents of the CentOS 7 DVD. MailCatcher is installed which will aid in testing SMTP configurations. LAB Server \u00b6 This server only has the core package group installed.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#project-overview","text":"Throughout my career, I've needed to achieve various certifications.
